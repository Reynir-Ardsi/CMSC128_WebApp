# CMSC 128_WebApp
ToDo List_WebApp

For our backend, we chose MongoDB

to run the webapp:
1. make sure to have node.js installed
in cmd type:
"node -v" ver check
"npm -v" ver check

2. inside the project folder where server.js is, to run the server
we first need to download the modules for node.js to access the mongodb cloud:
"npm init -y"
"npm install express mongoose cors"
but if the files are already included then there is no need to repeat this step

3. to run the server, you will need to access the location of "server.js" with the "cd"  command then input "node server.js" in cmd within the location of the file, make sure to have the module files within the same folder.

4. You should then see:
" ðŸš€ Server running"
which indicates that the server is online and is running smoothly otherwise any errors after that means it isn't

5. you can then open "main.html" the main page of the webapp. from there it would load and display the frontend with exisiting data
that you can either edit, delete, or add more to.
