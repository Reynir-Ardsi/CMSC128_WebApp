# CMSC 128_WebApp
ToDo List_WebApp

to run the webapp:
1. make sure to have node.js installed
in cmd type:
"node -v" ver check
"npm -v" ver check

2. inside the project folder where server.js is run the server:
"npm init -y"
"npm install express mongoose cors"
"node server.js" (to run the server)

3. to run "node server.js" in cmd within the location of the file, make sure to have the module files within the same folder

4. You should then see:
" ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:5000 "
which indicates that the server is online and is running smoothly

if any errors were to occur, you should be smart enough to fix it yourself as it is beyond my further concern hihi
